StoLat Insertion Parser Information Extraction DSL
==================================================

This library provides a DSL for information extraction using
the concept of insertion parsing. This allows for 'gapping' or
spurious elements allowing for more robust extraction.

The library leans heavily on generators, keeping only a fixed
window of the token stream in memory at any time.

The library is pure python, allowing it to be deployed in
restrictive environments such as Google App Engine.

Warnings
--------

This library is pre-alpha quality and the API may change at any
time. This was initially implemented in one evening as a challenge
to myself to express my idea for insertion parsing in as little
time as possible. It is intended that this will be developed in the
near future into a more full-featured and better architected library.

Installation
------------

See INSTALL.
